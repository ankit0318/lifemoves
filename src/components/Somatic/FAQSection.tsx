      question: "Do I need experience?",
      answer: "None. Just a body and some curiosity. This challenge is designed for complete beginners and works with whatever mobility you have."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this therapy?",
      answer: "It's healing â€” not clinical. Rooted in somatic movement and awareness practices that help you reconnect with your body naturally."
    },
    {
      question: "When does it start?",
      answer: "Immediately. Day 1 drops right after signup. You can start whenever you're ready and go at your own pace."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I have access?",
      answer: "Lifetime. Once you purchase, you can revisit the challenge anytime you need a reset."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I sweat?",
      answer: "You'll probably laugh more than you sweat. These are gentle, mindful movements focused on awareness rather than intensity."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I miss a day?",
      answer: "No guilt, no pressure. Pick up where you left off whenever you're ready. This is about self-compassion, not perfection."
